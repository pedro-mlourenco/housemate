# HouseMate

**HouseMate** is my pet project. The end goal is for HouseMate to be my personal organizer, allowing me to catalog my day-to-day activities for myself or anyone who might benefit from it.

I also started this project as a fun way to better apply technologies that I haven't had the opportunity to use professionally. Instead of a **.NET-based stack**, I'll use the **MERN stack** (*MongoDB, Express, React, and Node*). Initially, I'll use the **Atlas service** that MongoDB provides, but eventually, I'll transition to a **self-hosted model**.

This is a **restart** of the project due to a lack of organization on my part. This time, I'll keep the **server side** separate from the **client side**, joining them only for releases on GitHub.

As such, the project will be divided into **two repositories**:  
- **HouseMate-Server**  
- **HouseMate-Client**  

This way, changes can be made to one side of the project without unintentionally affecting the other.
